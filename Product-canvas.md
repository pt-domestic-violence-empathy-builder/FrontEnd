Proposal



 Financial insecurity is the No. 1 reason survivors of domestic violence remain in or return to abuse. In order to break the cycle of violence, we must remove obstacles to financial security for survivors. To that end, FreeFrom (https://www.freefrom.org/) is developing an interactive calculator for their website. It will be an empathy and awareness-building calculator to help those not experiencing violence understand how much it would cost for them to leave their lives. It will include prompts to help users understand and identify the relevant costs.

Features


MVP:
*A person interested in learning more about domestic violence can come to the page and insert their data into the online calculator.
*There will be two steps to the calculator, a personal monthly budget to determine what costs they need to cover, and a way to calculate the costs of relocating
*the monthly personal budget will allow them to enter their ongoing unavoidable costs they might have while trying to relocate. The fields include Transportation, Food, Health Insurance, car insurance, car loans, personal loans, and other expenses
*The relocation costs include: Daily hotel costs while in transit (if applicable, nightly rate * 30), new rental deposit, utility connection fees, storage unit, new monthly rent (if they already know this number), car rental and gas (if don't own a car), cell phone disconnection/connect fee (if they have to get a new number), moving truck rental, gas for moving truck, storage unit if unable to take their things with them, mental health treatment, income loss (what they are losing by leaving their current job), cost of any additional security measures they must take
*After they have entered these fields, a page will show up combining their total monthly expenses plus the monthly cost of relocation.

WiseupWomen provides financial education for their users, specifically targeting Gen X and Gen Y women. (the website is so bad though lol). Providing education to people who donâ€™t even know where to start might be a good follow up to the calculator. http://wiseupwomen.tamu.edu/

Udvc.org- utah domestic violence coalition has links to shelters and safe houses, color theming seems to be purple and teal across the board ( DV awareness color is purple). Also offers education on warning signs and tips on how to prepare to leave and how to get a protective order. On the financial aspect, might be a good idea to include the tips for financially planning for a leave including how to get titles for assets, and how to find free or sliding scale lawyers.
